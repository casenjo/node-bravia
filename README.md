# node-home-automation
I had been wanting to learn Node JS for a while and decided to start making my own home automation solution for certain things around here.

Initially I was going to go for a custom solution to send XML messages to Sony Bravia TVs but out of sheer luck I found this [other](https://github.com/shabunin/cf-sonytv) repo by shabunin. I forked it [here](https://github.com/casenjo/node-sonytv) to remove the dependency on CommandFusion and make it as NodeJS-friendly as possible :)
